# Hey there 👋

My name is Vaggelis and I'm a full-stack web developer, I live in Heraklion, Greece and I'm also a student at
Computer Science Department of University of Crete.

My speciality nowdays on Laravel, Livewire, Alpine JS and TailwindCSS (the famous [TALL stack](https://tallstack.dev/)).

I'm passionate about PWA's, Web components, Javascript, Rust and Python.

Oh! and I forgot to say that I'm performance freak, I try to make every site as performant as possible (I'm getting very angry when PageSpeeds show's score < 85)
