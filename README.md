# Hey there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Vaggelis and I'm a full-stack web developer, I live in Heraklion, Greece and I'm also a student at
Computer Science Department of University of Crete.

My speciality on the backend is Laravel, on the frontend is VueJS and nowdays I use TailwindCSS for styling.

I'm passionate about PWA's, Web components, Javascript, Rust and Python.

Oh! and I forgot to say that I'm performance freak, I try to make every site as performant as possible (I'm getting very angry when PageSpeeds show's score < 85)

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on SquareDash
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Livewire
